My first article! I've spent a bit of time setting this up, but hopefully it looks good as is right now. This blog is being built via Zola, and you can see all of the code for this blog [here](https://github.com/fairingrey/blog). Feel free to submit an issue if you have trouble viewing this blog or want to fix something in one of my templates.

I've created this blog in the hopes that it will be a more suitable vector for sharing my thoughts here on a variety of subjects. Writing a little bit more formally is always good practice, and more often than not it's a better method of expression than other forms of communication. It always seemt like when I would jot my ideas down on random notes of paper that something would get lost in the translation from mind to pen. That goes the same for when I'm articulating an idea in person or over Discord or the like.

Not that those methods are bad, of course. There's always an appropriate time and place for those kinds of things, but I want this blog to be a bit more special.

And so, whichever way you landed here, whether by checking my online profiles or through my resume or portfolio, welcome. I will probably be writing about a number of my passions and interests here, both of which may be either more oriented towards the technical side, or more towards the personal or creative side.

(WIP)

And as I like to have a bit of fun, here's a song I'm listening to. I've actually been listening to Vincent's For You EP on repeat for a while, and I enjoy it a lot.

Have a good one.
