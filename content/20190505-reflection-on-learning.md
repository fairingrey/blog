It's a hard truth to realize, but I didn't always deal well with failure. For as long as I can remember, I've been accustomed to the idea that to succeed, failure has to be avoided whenever possible -- that failure is the diametrical opposite of success.

I couldn't be more wrong.

I think one of the most critical things to realize as a software developer and engineer is that your growth depends on your willingless to learn, to try new things out, and eventually have those efforts not come out to anything valuable. Perhaps it's a wireframe design that didn't really pan out well, a backend application architecture that didn't work out as ideally as imagined, or even something as simple as trying to refactor a slightly more than complicated function in your code.

As the Anna Karenina principle states, any deficiency in a number of factors dooms the endeavor to fail. Thus, all variables must succeed.

But code usually doesn't pan out nearly that perfectly, and neither do humans. But the important thing to take away is that, instead of viewing failure as something that can't be fixed or worked around, it should be a growing experience.

It's something I wish I realized earlier in my academic and professional career. And I've always wanted to discuss that change of mindset, the change that allowed me to become a better programmer, and to not fear, but embrace failure.

## My Experience as a Computer Science Undergrad Major

In the spring of 2013, I happened to land into the major and specialization of Computer Science, through the recommendation of a friend I met in my Calculus I course. This was my first exposure to the discipline of software development.

I was originally admitted to my university as an English major because it was something that seemed nominally better than being "undeclared". Truth be told, I didn't want to stay doing it, as my brother was also admitted to the same university last year as a civil engineering major. I decided I would change my major to the next suitable thing possible whenever the chance would arise: something that would hold my interest and exploit my strengths, and something I could get paid fairly well for.

One thing led to another, and eventually I decided I would major in Computer Science after taking a class in programming basics. At the time, I remember believing I had the algorithmic and programmatical aptitude for what the major required. So I went with it, and I ended up doing fairly well.

Throughout the Computer Science program I also spent a lot of time at my university's Computer Science club, learning and discussing various things, though never really trying out anything big and new. I also played a lot of video games and watched anime in the downtime I wasn't in class and over each seasonal break.

It was a difficult major, given, but at the end of four and a half grueling years in the gauntlet of a Computer Science program, I ended up with a nice degree to hang up on my wall, along with two Dean's Scholar awards I was awarded because of my continued diligence in keeping good grades the last two years finishing up my final program requirements.

It was fun, but in retrospect I think I didn't really make the most of it. At the end of those four and a half years, I still didn't really know what I wanted to do, aside from hopefully getting a cushy engineering job at some enterprise company in Java or C#, or whatever was hot in the job market. And I think that mindset did hurt me in the coming months after graduation.

## After Graduation

When I graduated in January 2017, I started going through the process of applying to jobs that were looking for recent college graduates in Computer Science or related disciplines, as do many recent grads in the field do.

However, my first several months of applying to jobs were *brutal*. I've had a pretty low self-esteem for as long as I can remember, and while I did try my best to apply to as many jobs as I could, I often shrugged away from jobs if I felt like I could not fulfill at least 70% of the requirements, and this was before I even knew most online job postings were usually bull. I cut myself short too often, and I couldn't really understand why job postings asked for so much. Oftentimes, after each and every failed job screening or phone interview I would constantly question myself and my accomplishments. After all, I didn't really know "software" much as I did various vague computer science concepts that I've already quickly pushed out of my short term memory after cramming for tests, exams, and homework.

It was my fault that I didn't even really know what developing software *meant* to begin with. I thought developing software would mostly include following a fairly archetypal pattern of designing and writing decent code or fixing bugs, but the field is vast and full of things to learn that school never teaches you. Sometimes it feels as if you're looking up a hill that seems impossible to climb; and it was, for someone still stuck in a fixed mindset. I didn't have a job mentor or another reference to guide me through the rungs of what its' like to actually do "software engineering" either.

The few times I did get an interview, the hiring process would stop after the first few technical rounds of screening or whiteboard interviews. Back then I could confidently say I was decent at algorithms and data structures, but I tripped up under pressure. I just felt like I wasn't gaining any ground anywhere, despite habitual stints on LeetCode and other practice sites like it.

It was several cycles of starting the job search, following job opportunities that failed to come to fruition, having my self-esteem being hurt, and then stopping the job search for a bit until I could collect that tiny bit of courage and recycle myself back into the rhythm. After roughly nine to ten months of being through the wringer of numerous failed applications, I sincerely thought I wasn't cut out for it. I kept in touch with friends who were in the same struggle; Someone I was close friends with at university, who did a double major in Computer Science and Math, failed to find anything, eventually settling down and working a blue-collar job outside of his field.

All in the meantime I still kept up the habit of watching anime and reading manga, just to protect my mind from that reality. My parents did inevitably get frustrated with it, and I told my dad it just wasn't working out, only for him to start telling his friends at work to tell their kids not to graduate in Computer Science; because of my experience.

There's this mental pattern people working in this field recognize as [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), where someone doubts their ability to succeed and fails to internalize their own accomplishments as a sign of their competence. A quick Google search will point you to numerous blogposts and threads on the topic. I wasn't even aware of such a thing until about an entire year after I graduated, I got to know someone through an online community who let me know that I wasn't alone in this regard.

One thing came to another, and eventually I stopped searching for jobs entirely for the months between November 2017 and March 2018. In that time, I simply just did odd jobs for my family and kept under the excuse that I was still figuring out what to do with my career.

## Starting from Zero

Around April 2018, after some arduous self-debate, I decided I would try going back into software development with the assumption I knew nothing, and my degree only prepared me a cursory jump-start into the field; the rest of my knowledge and experience I would have to foot on my own.

2017 was a long, stressful year. For 2018, I took the time to really take it easier on myself, to offload a lot of the stress from the job search, and just to rethink what I wanted out of my career.

I took a closer look back at what I really liked during university, and what I actually wanted to do for a living; what kind of software I could work on and build and the kinds of things that would invigorate and motivate me. My two favorite courses during my time at university were Programming Languages and Paradigms, and Formal Languages and Computability. I think these two courses in particular really defined the type of developer I would become and the things I would value. I didn't value the practice of "software engineering" as much as I did the theory and expressiveness of code in software.

So I needed a project to work on, and a domain to specialize in. I read somewhere that when starting to get into the field, it's best to pick one domain and stick with it, that way your attention isn't lost on other things and you have something to feel motivated in your progress about. I ended up picking backend web development, because there was something that I really wanted to create, and I felt like creating a well-organized web app from the ground up would be the best thing I could do, as I would be free to try out all the ideas I had for what the backend would look like.

This was the time I really started digging deep into languages such as Go, Python, TypeScript, and Rust. In addition I also picked up other necessary technologies and tools such as PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and Insomnia. I followed this [backend developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) at the start, until I grasped most of the concepts there.

I also decided at this time I had enough of being on Windows -- It was slow, and often broke when I wanted to try new projects. I installed Arch and got comfortable with it. It was something I wish I did sooner.

Around May 2018, I decided I would be going to grad school, in the hopes that I'd do the things I wish I did in undergrad, and redoing the things I did do, better. The window had already closed for the fall semester for the Computer Science Master's program, so come August I applied for the Master's program in Software Engineering that would start Spring 2019.

Grad school wasn't really something I wanted to do much as it was *something* to do, and to convince my parents I was going to do something meaningful. As I figured out a few weeks after I started attending the Spring 2019 semester, the program was simply not something I wanted to continue doing. It was also expensive, and I didn't really want to be stuck in debt and still be behind in the job search, so I dropped out last March and went full-in on open source software.
