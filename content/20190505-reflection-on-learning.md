It's a hard truth to realize, but I didn't always deal well with failure. For as long as I can remember, I've been accustomed to the idea that to succeed, failure has to be avoided whenever possible -- that failure is the diametrical opposite of success.

I couldn't be more wrong.

I think one of the most critical things to realize as a software developer and engineer is that your growth depends on your willingless to learn, to try new things out, and eventually have those efforts not come out to anything valuable. Perhaps it's a wireframe design that didn't really pan out well, a backend application architecture that didn't work out as ideally as imagined, or even something as simple as trying to refactor a slightly more than complicated function in your code. As the Anna Karenina principle states, any deficiency in a number of factors dooms the endeavor to fail -- thus, all variables must succeed.

But code usually doesn't pan out nearly that perfectly. Usually within any user-programmed system are holes in design and algorithmic logic, as it is our nature as humans to make mistakes. However, the important thing to take away is that, instead of viewing failure as something that can't be fixed or worked around, it should be a growing experience.

It's something I wish I realized earlier in my academic and professional career. And I've always wanted to discuss that change of mindset, the change that allowed me to become a better programmer, and to not fear, but embrace failure.

## My Experience as a Computer Science Undergrad Student

In the spring of 2013, I happened to land into the major and specialization of Computer Science, through the recommendation of a friend I met in my Calculus I course. This was my first exposure to the discipline of software development.

I was originally admitted to my university as an English major because it was something that seemed nominally better than being "undeclared". And, truth be told, I didn't want to stay doing it, as my brother was also admitted to the same university last year as a civil engineering major. I decided I would change my major to the next suitable thing possible whenever the chance would arise. Something that would be interesing to me and exploit my strengths, and something I could get paid fairly well for.

One thing led to another, and eventually I caved and decided I would major in Computer Science after taking a class in programming basics. At that time, I think I had a fairly strong algorithmic and programmatical aptitude for what the major required. In addition to putting up with the courses, I spent a lot of time as an undergrad student at my university's Computer Science club, learning and discussing various things, though never really trying out anything big and new. I also played a lot of video games and watched anime in the downtime I wasn't in class and over each seasonal break.

It was a difficult major, given, but at the end of four and a half grueling years in the gauntlet of a Computer Science program, I ended up with a nice degree to hang up on my wall, along with two Dean's Scholar awards I was awarded because of my continued diligence to keep good grades in the last two years finishing up my final program requirements.

It was fun, don't get me wrong, but in retrospect I think I didn't really make the most of it. At the end of those four and a half years, I still didn't really know what I wanted to do, aside from hopefully getting a cushy engineering job at some enterprise company in Java/C#, or whatever was hot in the job market. And I think that mindset did hurt me in the coming months after graduation.

## After Graduation

When I graduated in January 2017, I started going through the process of applying to jobs that were looking for recent college graduates in Computer Science or related disciplines, as do most recent grads in my field do.

My first several months of applying to jobs were *brutal*. I've had a pretty low self-esteem for as long as I can remember, and while I did try my best to apply to as many jobs as I could, I often shrugged away from jobs if I felt like I could not fulfill at least 80% of the requirements. I cut myself short too often, and I couldn't really understand why job postings asked for so much. Oftentimes, after each and every failed job screening or phone interview I would constantly question myself and my accomplishments. After all, I didn't really know "software" much as I did various vague computer science concepts that I've quickly pushed out of my short term memory after cramming for tests, exams, and homework.

It was on my fault that I didn't even really know what developing software *meant*. I thought developing software would be a fairly archetypal pattern of designing and writing nice code or fixing bugs, but the field is vast and full of things to learn that school never teaches you. Sometimes it feels as if you're looking up a hill that seems impossible to climb; and it was, for someone still stuck in a fixed mindset. I didn't have a job mentor or other references of sorts to guide me through the rungs of what its' like to actually do "software engineering" either.

It was several cycles of starting the job search, encountering job opportunities that failed to come to fruition, having my self-esteem being hurt, and then stopping the job search for a bit until I could collect a small moment of courage and recycle myself back into the rhythm. After roughly nine to ten months of being through the wringer of numerous failed applications, I sincerely thought I wasn't cut out for it. I kept in touch with friends who were in the same pit; Someone I was close friends with throughout university, that did a double major in Computer Science and Math failed to find anything, eventually settling down and working a blue-collar job outside of his field.

All in the meantime I still kept up the habit of playing video games, watching anime and reading manga, just to shield myself from that reality. Eventually my parents did get frustrated with it, and I did inevitably tell my dad it just wasn't working out, only for him to start telling his friends at work to tell their kids not to graduate in Computer Science; because of my experience.

There's this mental pattern people working in this field recognize as [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), where someone doubts their ability to succeed and fails to internalize their own accomplishments as a sign of their competence. There are numerous blogposts and threads on the topic; a quick Google search will point you to these. I wasn't even aware of such a thing until about an entire year after I graduated, I got to know someone through an online anime community who let me know that I wasn't alone in this regard.

Eventually I stopped searching for jobs entirely for the months between November 2017 and March 2018. In that meantime, I simply just did odd jobs for my family and kept under the excuse that I was still figuring out what to do with my career, telling both my parents I decided I would be going to grad school. Grad school wasn't really something I wanted to do much as it was *something* to do, and eventually I figured out this was also a mistake. More on that later, though.
