It's a hard truth to realize, but I didn't always deal well with failure. For as long as I can remember, I've been accustomed to the idea that to succeed, failure has to be avoided whenever possible -- that failure is the diametrical opposite of success.

I couldn't be more wrong.

I think one of the most critical things to realize as a software developer and engineer is that your growth depends on your willingless to learn, to try new things out, and eventually have those efforts not come out to anything valuable. Perhaps it's a wireframe design that didn't really pan out well, a backend application architecture that didn't work out as ideally as imagined, or even something as simple as trying to refactor a slightly more than complicated function in your code. As the Anna Karenina principle states, any deficiency in a number of factors dooms the endeavor to fail -- thus, all variables must succeed.

But code usually doesn't pan out nearly that perfectly. Usually within any user-programmed system are holes in design and algorithmic logic, as it is our nature as humans to make mistakes. However, the important thing to take away is that, instead of viewing failure as something that can't be fixed or worked around, it should be a growing experience.

It's something I wish I realized earlier in my academic and professional career. And I've always wanted to discuss that change of mindset, the change that allowed me to become a better programmer, and to not fear, but embrace failure.

## My Experience as a Computer Science Undergrad Student

In the spring of 2013, I happened to land into the major and specialization of Computer Science, through the recommendation of a friend I met in my Calculus I course. This was my first exposure to the discipline of software development.

I was originally admitted to my university as an English major because it was something that seemed nominally better than being "undeclared". And, truth be told, I didn't want to stay doing it, as my brother was also admitted to the same university last year as a civil engineering major. I decided I would change my major to the next suitable thing possible whenever the chance would arise. Something that would be interesing to me and exploit my strengths, and something I could get paid fairly well for.

One thing led to another, and eventually I caved and decided I would major in Computer Science after taking a class in programming basics. At that time, I think I had a fairly strong algorithmic and programmatical aptitude for what the major required. In addition to putting up with the courses, I spent a lot of time as an undergrad student at my university's Computer Science club, learning and discussing various things, though never really trying out anything big and new. I also played a lot of video games and watched anime in the downtime I wasn't in class and over each seasonal break.

It was a difficult major, given, but at the end of four and a half grueling years in the gauntlet of a Computer Science program, I ended up with a nice degree to hang up on my wall, along with two Dean's Scholar awards I was awarded because of my continued diligence to keep good grades in the last two years finishing up my final program requirements.

It was fun, don't get me wrong, but in retrospect I think I didn't really make the most of it. At the end of those four and a half years, I still didn't really know what I wanted to do, aside from hopefully getting a cushy engineering job at some enterprise company in Java/C#, or whatever was hot in the job market. And I think that mindset did hurt me in the coming months after graduation.

## After Graduation

When I graduated in January 2017, I started going through the process of applying to jobs that were looking for recent college graduates in Computer Science or related disciplines, as do most recent grads in my field do.
